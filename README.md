# ScreenCircle - Android Screen Time Tracker

ScreenCircle is an Android application that tracks your daily screen-on time and allows you to share it with friends in **Private Groups**. Challenge your friends to reduce screen time!

## 🚀 Features
- **Zero Battery Usage**: Uses Android's UsageStatsManager (same as Digital Wellbeing) - no background service!
- **Weekly Statistics**: View your screen time history with beautiful charts.
- **Private Groups**: Create or join groups to share stats with specific people.
- **Leaderboard**: Compete with friends - less screen time = higher rank! 👑
- **Background Sync**: WorkManager syncs data every 6 hours even if you don't open the app.
- **Material 3 Design**: Modern and clean UI with Material You support.

## 🔋 Why ScreenCircle is Battery-Friendly

Unlike other screen time apps that run constant background services, ScreenCircle:
- **Reads data from Android's built-in tracking** (UsageStatsManager)
- **No foreground service** = No persistent notification
- **Syncs every 6 hours** using WorkManager (only 4 times per day!)
- **Respects battery saver mode** automatically

| Metric | ScreenCircle | Other Apps |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Background Battery | **~0.03%/day** | 1-5%/day |
| Background Data | **~4 KB/day** | 10-100 KB/day |
| Permissions | **3** | 5-8 |
| Persistent Notification | **No** | Yes |
| Sync Frequency | Every 6 hours | Constant |

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions (IMPORTANT)

### 1. Firebase Setup
You **MUST** set up Firebase for this app to work.

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Create a new project.
3. Add an Android App with package name: `com.example.screencircle`.
4. Download `google-services.json` and place it in the `app/` directory of this project. For compile-only local verification without real Firebase credentials, copy the sanitized fixture instead:
   ```bash
   cp app/google-services.json.example app/google-services.json
   ```
   The destination `app/google-services.json` is Git-ignored. This fixture is only for compilation/local verification; runtime authentication and sync still require a valid developer Firebase configuration.
5. **Enable Authentication**:
   - Go to Build > Authentication > Sign-in method.
   - Enable **Email/Password**.
6. **Enable Realtime Database**:
   - Go to Build > Realtime Database > Create Database.
   - Start in **Test Mode** (or use the rules below).

### 2. Database Rules

> **Security warning:** the rules below are prototype-only. They let any authenticated user read every user profile and usage record, and write any group. **Do not deploy them to a production Firebase project.** The hardened schema and authorization rules (private/public profiles, member-scoped groups, invite hashes) are specified in [`docs/plans/2026-09-25-screencircle-production-hardening-design.md`](docs/plans/2026-09-25-screencircle-production-hardening-design.md) and still need to be implemented.

For local prototyping only, copy these rules to your Firebase Realtime Database Rules tab:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "users": {
      "$uid": {
        ".read": "auth != null",
        ".write": "$uid === auth.uid"
      }
    },
    "groups": {
      ".read": "auth != null",
      ".write": "auth != null"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Build & Run
1. Open the project in **Android Studio** (Hedgehog or newer recommended).
2. Sync Gradle.
3. Run on a device or emulator (API 26+).
4. **Grant Permission**: The app will ask for "Usage Access". You must enable it for ScreenCircle in the system settings.

## 📱 Permissions Used (Only 3!)
| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `INTERNET` | Firebase sync |
| `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` | Check connectivity before sync |
| `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS` | Read screen time from Android |

**No foreground service, no boot receiver, no notifications required!**

## 🎮 How to Use

### Track Your Screen Time
1. Open the app and grant Usage Access permission
2. Your screen time is automatically read from Android's built-in tracking
3. View your stats on the Home tab

### Create/Join a Group
1. Go to the Groups tab
2. Tap "Create Group" and enter a name
3. Share the Group ID with friends
4. Friends tap "Join Group" and enter the ID

### Leaderboard
- Members are ranked by screen time (ascending)
- Less screen time = Higher rank
- 👑 Crown for 1st place, 🥈 for 2nd, 🥉 for 3rd

## 🏗️ How It Works

### Screen Time Tracking
```
Android UsageStatsManager → ScreenTimeRepository → Firebase
         ↓
   (Digital Wellbeing)
```
- We read from Android's built-in tracking (same data as Digital Wellbeing)
- Zero battery for tracking - Android already does it!
- Sync to Firebase when app opens OR every 6 hours via WorkManager

### Background Sync Flow
```
WorkManager (every 6 hours)
    → Check if user logged in
    → Check if permission granted
    → Read today's screen time
    → Upload to Firebase
    → Done! (~1 second, ~0.008% battery)
```
